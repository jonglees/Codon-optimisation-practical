# Codon-optimisation-practical

The biotech company you work for wants to use codon usage https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codon_usage_bias to improve protein expression, can you help with your combined ML/Bio skills..good luck. 


The code to get you started is here: https://github.com/jonglees/Codon-optimisation-practical/blob/main/rf_optimise.ipynb

(The example here is based on this paper https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36718935/ we adapt the dataset to a theoretical scenario)
